# Raccoon Search Party

This is practice specifically for searching and posting in React.

## Getting Started

Fork and clone the assignment. Run `npm install` followed by `npm run server` and `npm start`.

For any fetches, you'll be using `http://localhost:5001/raccoons`.

## Deliverable One

Fetch and render all the raccoons using the `RaccoonCard` and the `RaccoonsContainer` components.

## Deliverable Two

Set up the `RaccoonForm` so that you can create a new raccoon with a name and image URL. Make sure to use a controlled form. When creating a new raccoon, it should appear once submitted and also persist to the database.

## Deliverable Three

Set up the `Search` component so that when someone types something in, only raccoons whose name includes the search term are shown.
